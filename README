This is the buildsystem for the OpenWrt Linux distribution.

To build your own firmware you need a Linux, BSD or MacOSX system (case
sensitive filesystem required). Cygwin is unsupported because of the lack
of a case sensitive file system.

You need gcc, binutils, bzip2, flex, python3.5+, perl, make, find, grep, diff,
unzip, gawk, getopt, subversion, libz-dev and libc headers installed.

slow-boat customisations
------------------------
To make it easier, there is a configs subdirectory. In this contains pre-defined
target setups. Currently pi0w is the only one supported since this fork is all about
making a budget audio DSP.

The next steps create a common download folder in the parent folder in case you
want to have multiple build environments in parallel (different targets for example).
Additionally we symlink various pre-configured files to save the tedium.
Choose intended target- in this case the PI0W without bluetooth.

mkdir ../dl
ln -s ../dl dl
ln -s configs/pi0w-no_bt.config .config
ln -s configs/pi0w.files files

1. Run "./scripts/feeds update -a" to obtain all the latest package definitions
defined in feeds.conf / feeds.conf.default

2. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" to install symlinks for all obtained
packages into package/feeds/

2b. Run "./scripts/feeds install -a" again to capture any missing/ill-defined dependencies

3. Run "make menuconfig" to ammend your preferred configuration for the
toolchain, target system & firmware packages.

4. Run "make -j9" to build your firmware. This will download all sources, build
the cross-compile toolchain and then cross-compile the Linux kernel & all
chosen applications for your target system.
